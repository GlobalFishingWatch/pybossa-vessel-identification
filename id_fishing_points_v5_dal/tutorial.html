                <p>Thank you for helping Global Fishing Watch!</p>
                <p>The goal of this project is to identify when a vessel is fishing. You will be shown the tracks of a vessel for a month, and your tasks will be to label the points in that month.</p>
                <p>When the month loads, every point's default value is "Unlabled / Don't Know." The easiest way to identify likely is to use the polygon tool and draw a circle around the points. When a point is labeled as fishing, it changes to be a larger cicle with a black ring around it.</p>
                <p>You can label points as "likely not fishing" using the same tool. Points that are likely not fishing will have a green circle around them.</p>
                <p>You can also click on the points and toggle between likely not fishing, fishing, and not labeled / don't know </p>
                <p>If you don't know, leave the points as are and don't label them.</p>
                <p>Below the map are two charts showing all the datapoints over the month. The charts look the same, but the top chart has two sliders that you can move to narrow the range of datapoints that are shown. It is often easiest to move the slider and label one day at a time.</p>
                <p>When you are done, you can click on Submit.</p>
                <p>If a month loads that you know you can't classify, or that you want to skip, you can click on "Skip".
