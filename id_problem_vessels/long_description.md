Thank you for helping Global Fishing Watch identify vessels!

These are vessels that are in our likely fishing vessels, appear to be "fishing" more than 10 percent of the time based on our original logistic regression model, but which are given a non-fishing label by the neural net. We have also filtered out Chinese vessels and vessels with Invalid MMSI. 

You likely will only be able to classify a fraction of these vessels -- but it will be helpful to do so.
